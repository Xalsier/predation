I'm really sorry about rewriting this so many times. 1st manuscript was a bust, writers block is a hell of pain, and the webcomic was difficult for me (my drawing skills suck).<br><br><strong>HOPEFULLY</strong> I can write Chapter 1 and not go back and decide to do a total rewrite for the 100th time. (Future me, if your rereading this, <strong>DONT DO IT!!! PLEASE. THINK OF YOUR SANITY.</strong>)<br><br>I will keep working on improving my art so that it's appealing. If you're reading this during the early stages, your going to see my messy code. And my messy art. Trust me. A new shiny coat of paint will come. I'll try to commission better artists than me if enough of you complain lol.<br><br>Alright, I've ranted enough. I hope you enjoy the story! ^-^</div>

        <div class="chapter_content" style="display: none;"><strong>## 1. Episode 1 - Naori's first hunt, Rabbit out of water!</strong><br><br>The milky lake bubbled as the young fox pushed the oar against the dock- setting their rowboat off from the port.<br><br>This would be her first solo hunt, without the help of her mothers, Shiro and Sera.<br><br>Mist from the geothermal lake passed her as she crossed further. The onsen disappeared gradually as the mist muddled it's appearance.<br><br>Naori had her sights on finding a new territory to hunt in. Past the river gorge.<br><br>Her stomach protested as she rowed, the oars just heavy enough that each trading swish was a challenge.<br><br>Above the fog, the green night sky proved to be cloudier tonight. The stars remained as bright as they ever were and as active. Not a delay in their appearance as the screen of atmospheric algae displayed their true nature better than their slow paced starlight ever could.<br><br>An advantage was making itself known. If these were the denser parasitic clouds full of metallic scraps, she'd have the full cover of night. Her eyes could see fairly well under those conditions. <br><br>For as long as it the metal rain stays in the clouds, she'd have her window.<br><br>She uttered a few short prayers to the wind in fox-speak, it coming out more as a growl. The smell of food was intoxicating and yet fully out of reach.<br><br>Shadows of one of the clouds passed over her as Naori's wooden rowboat approached the entrance to the narrow river gorge. They were marked by Valentine's Cattails scattered across the white river.<br><br>A mix of actual cattails, and abandoned tails. The bridge above the gorge was a popular dueling spot. It was a mixed bag, sometimes the victor would drop the opponents tail to grow here and it'd thrive or end up boney. Or they'd keep the victors tail as a trophy if they were noteworthy.<br><br>The thought made her uncomfortable as she tucked her tail below her, self-conscious, but nothing was more uneasy than watching as the ones still thriving in the river swished back and forth reacting to Naori's boat. Even the boney ones.<br><br>One, brave enough to slide it's bones across her neck, was met with her fist out of instinct as it clattered into pieces- held together by weak flower stems.<br><br><strong>"(Fox yelp)"</strong><br><br>Naori felt her rowboat shift off course as some of tails pushed her boat off course against the cliff. The tails creaked and snapped, some breaking off as they worked in unison.<br><br>Large Fragments chipped off her rowboat from the damage. She struggled to retain control of her oars, pushing the cliff to get back on the river path.<br><br>She noticed some broken rowboats in the dark as her yellow experimental eyes began adjusting to the dark. The night sky was beginning to strangle the stars.<br><br>A snake tail tried wrapping around her waist to pull her off board. Hooking her hindpaws below the rowboat, she heated up her volcanic bluesteel claws and slashed at the scales, fighting to stay on the rowboat.<br><br>It constricted as blood ripped out of it causing her to gasp for air. She tore pieces out the tail out until it gave up, but by then another tail had broken off another piece of the rowboat and a weaker one coaxed out one of her oars leaving her with just one.<br><br>After ripping it out of the oarlock after 2 tugs, the hold shattered and stayed with the oar. Naori swung the oar forcing her to treat the small boat like a canoe. It was much slower, but she had more range to swing at the boney tails with two hands on the oar.<br><br>While hope felt to be slipping, the milky water that was falling in her boat was more polluted. A sign that she was at the very least closer to the outer boundaries of boats that failed to cross this stream.<br><br>She felt her boat moving again as the cattails shifted it off course, not even her single oar could make much of a difference. It crashed again into the cliff on her right- the force almost creating enough knockback to make her fall off the rowboat.<br><br>More fragments of the ship broke off and she could feel it beginning to sink as half of the river was in the boat. Holding off some of the cattails with a few swings, Naori tried pushing the boat away from the cliff face.<br><br>This time, the oar went through the rocks catching her off guard. A false wall.<br><br>Naori stood on top of one of the wooden seats as the boat she was on sunk further into the river. She could only hope they wouldn't try to follow her. With a sharp swing at one of the larger tails, she dropped the oar and dived into the wall.<br><br>The fox found herself submerged in the river, but there were no tails chasing her. They treated it as a normal wall.<br><br>She watched as everything she brought for her for the hunt submerged. The bag's for carrying anything larger than she could eat, the smaller but still useful things like rope and nets for making a trap.<br><br>The pain killer medicine for nightmares and in case she'd get injured.. among other things..even her mixtures were lost.<br><br>Her mother(s) spoke often about these as they were everywhere. Some would be below the ground and would give way to porcupine spikes or something more sinister. Other projections produced by pheromones would be as simple as a tree pretending to be like it's neighbors- making identification for gathering resources more complicated.<br><br>Holding her breath, she could see what the tails really looked like. It was a cobbled mess of blood veins rooted across the river bed. She was...somewhat surprised it wasn't trying to puppeteer something more complicated.<br><br>But maybe a tail was the simplest thing it could manipulate. She didn't want to be around when it found out how to do more.<br><br>She waded through the water, which brought her into what was an underground cave that seemed to get smaller towards the back. From the washed up fur stuck to the walls, it appeared that this cave flooded in pretty frequently.<br><br><strong>Is this a dead end?</strong> <br><br>Towards the dry surface she found a couple of boney tails. that made their way here. Naori stepped on one, shattering it, before exploring further. Her bright bioluminescent eyes guided the way.<br><br>A crawlspace was visible at the end, naturally made. She got down on her knees and began journeying through it. If there was a false wall, then there had to be something at the end of this.<br><br>Covered in rocky dust, Naori slashed through some dirt and pulled herself up. <br><br>It was a dark forest, shrouded by the dense clouds above. It seemed to really be a cave even though she could see the sky- and even the drizzle of metal rain collided with the earth at the top along with vague silhouettes of trees.<br><br>Across the forest, she could see glowing white lotus petals floating in the air...almost without gravity. <br><br><strong>What are these curious things?</strong><br><br>Naori tried to hold one in her hand. It changed into a a translucent red when she blinked and shriveled up, before following a stray wind pattern.<br><br>She decided she'd take a closer look at the flora when she found food. <br><br>Naori retrieved her phone from her belt. Using the map Ryo drew, she plotted down the location and texted him.<br><br><strong>Naori</strong><br><strong>"There's a false wall near Bahu River. Wouldn't recommend crossing it, but I'll let you know what I find."</strong><br><br><strong>Naori</strong><br><strong>"Good luck with the delivery,"</strong><br><br>She uploaded a few pictures from her eye's memory. <br><br>Ryo was working on a map for the Viritian Alps. She didn't know when he'd be finished with all the POI's. Maybe he never would be.<br><br>He and Sera were going to discuss the current state of the map with Chief Avali. That was all she knew. Given the territories changed every moon, fresh information was always valuable. The marks where spike pits were saved her a couple of times.<br><br>Her mouth was watering unconsciously as the smell of rabbit was strong here, along with cooked fish. <br><br>Below her, as blood dripped from her waist from when she fought the snake tail, white grass grew. A trail of sorts leading back to the cave. <br><br>At least she'd know how to get back.<br><br><br>---<br>#### Quantum Flora<br><br><em>Nature's mastery of entropy, mimicking the original quantum technology used by early Mekazoa. Terrestrially, parasitic wind provide the means to cultivate the behavior consistently without friction.</em><br><br><em>This symbiotic relationship is a byproduct attempting to recreate the anomalous conditions that allowed the flowers to exist in the first place. </em>They exist in all possible states, all at once.<em><br><br> </em>By their nature, they also have the ability to integrate with Mekazoan technology. To those who remember their disruptive past, cultivators of this flower are seen as a threat.*<br><br>---<br><br>A young rabbit with no name sat by his campfire, eating cooked fish. <br><br>He closed his eyes, biting and savoring the flavor. The soft relaxing sound of taps across the sky from the rain comforted him mixed with the crackle of the firepit.<br><br>His arms felt quite weak from carrying the a single log over here to form a seat as he was tired of always sitting on the orange grass.<br><br>Many nights were spent just to carve it out of the tree. He had no claws, and his teeth were quite dull. All he had were primitive rocks. <br><br>While the tools he had near him weren't convenient, he tried to make his meal look as beautiful as it could. Some of the rocks here had minerals that tasted salty. A pinch of the dust followed by some edible leafs.<br><br>As he chewed the fish, a tear ran down his eye.<br><br>He didn't quite know who these fish were in a past life. But he knew, deep down, that they had suffered. The rabbit saw faint glimpses of their pain in his dreams. <br><br>Even if this dish wasn't perfect, he tried to respect their journey as much as possible by making the meal as flavorful as he could.<br><br>The rabbit didn't know why nature chose to give him humanity and not the fish. Maybe it had to do with the lotus flowers that formed in the wind when he drooled over his food.<br><br><strong>You deserve honor. As much as I'm able to give you with what I have.</strong><br><br>In return, the fish were quite tasty.<br><br>A chill of wind passed around him. The pieces of a reddish lotus petal flew through the air around him before flying into the tall grass.<br><br>The grass shimmered as white lotus petals floating inside of it flew up, speckling.<br><br>He stayed closer to the fire for warmth and ate another bite of the fish. The petals were confusing. Sometimes they would follow the wind, and other times they hovered in the air.<br><br>Across the lake in front of him they had specular rainbow colors as lotuses on the lilypads. They were even stranger. When they appeared on the lake, it would be with a crackle of wind and they bloomed with these dark 'voids' at the center of them.<br><br>If he placed his paw inside, the petals changed colors rapidly. It scared him so he didn't try investigating further. It felt so unstable that it might have been close to chopping his wrist off.<br><br>A giant one rested as a large bud at the center of the lake. <br><br>The rabbit lowered his shoulders at ease and thought of the life this fishy must have had. Even as his meal, it must have been a calmer life that the one he had glimpses of.<br><br>Another gust of wind blew behind his back.<br><br>He flinched and looked over his shoulder cautiously. Just a bunch of tall grasses. They were edible but they didn't taste all that wonderful.<br><br>Returning to his meal he sniffed the air, smelling the intoxicating scent of the salmon. Behind him, two yellow bioluminescent eyes emerged as a reflection in the translucent milky lake.<br><br><strong>"E- (Panicked rabbit chirps)"</strong><br><br>The fox lunged at him and the plate with his cooked salmon clattered to the side of the firepit. Their initial lunge was slow enough to give him some initial room to leap but they had grabbed ahold on his leg.<br><br>He kicked rapidly to break for freedom- but their grip on his ankle was stronger.<br><br>All he had left were the rocks near him, but the fox seemed to block each one that he threw with her arm. The sharper one drew only a speck of blood at the silhouette of the fox with bright yellow eyes.<br><br>"Where are your claws, small rabbit?" <br><br>As they asked the question, they dug their claws into his back. It felt like a sharp red hot pick of steel burning deep in his chest, lifting him up.<br><br>"(shriller panicked chirps) I- I don't have-"<br><br>His attempts to speak were cut off with a gasp and met with the fox clamping their teeth down on his ear, chewing it.<br><br>The fox lifted him closer to the fire. As the hot drip of blood rolled down his face, his eyes darted to the plate of salmon.<br><br><strong>"Try- t-t- Wait..."</strong><br><br>There was a ripping tear as a piece of his ear came shredded off. The fox continued to chew on it, watching, but mumbled in curiosity.<br><br><strong>"Hm?"</strong> <br><br>His right paw, shaking with fear, gestured to the imperfect wooden bowl he had carved with a rock some time ago.<br><br>There was still at least two salmon and bits of the one he was eating left in it, although the presentation wasn't as ordered as he'd like it.<br><br>She swallowed the ear. The gulp sending prickles up the fur around his neck.<br><br><strong>"Oh. I see. You've made a meal for me."</strong><br><br><strong>"Do you think it will save you? (Sniff)"</strong><br><br><strong>". ."</strong><br><br><strong>"(Fox whine) What will I do? It smells wonderful..but senses can be deceiving."</strong><br><br>The rabbit struggled under the burning grip tearing through his chest. <br><br>He felt as if he was dying, but in a way he couldn't fully understand. This type of injury would have killed him as a human. That much he knew.<br><br><strong>"If you...y.. (Coughs blood)"</strong><br><br>Lotus petals formed in the air our of the blood, swirling in a low gravity state.<br><br><strong>"That is SO weird! I can't understand what your saying, let me set you down while I eat."</strong><br><br>When the fox released their grip, he fell to the ground- dizzy. It felt as if he had lost a significant portion of his will.<br><br>It didn't feel as if he could get up yet, his muscles felt limp. <br><br>The rabbit watched as the fox sat down by the log and ate what was on the wooden bowl in large gulps- not appreciating the journey the fish went through to get there.<br><br>It was then under the light of the campfire that he realized that she was almost the same height as him.<br><br>Yet, he was almost weightless when she picked him up. How strong was she?<br><br>He suppressed throwing up another piece of blood.<br><br><strong>"There's...more fish."</strong><br><br>The fox nodded. <br><br><strong>"I can smell them. Does it matter? I can't hunt them."</strong><br><br><strong>"And your a much easier piece of prey."</strong><br><br>The rabbit turned their attention weakly to their fishing rod perched at the edge of the lake.<br><br><strong>"Your a funny rabbit. You think you can catch fish with that? I've seen better equipment, silly."</strong><br><br>Struggling to pick himself up, he nodded. The rabbit felt disorientated but it felt as if his senses were returning to him. In the back of his mind, he recognized somewhat subconsciously that a single blow would be the end of him.<br><br><strong>"Okay. I'll indulge in your confidence. If you catch enough fish for me, equal to your weight, I won't eat you today."</strong><br><br>The fish of this lake were easy to catch for a reason. The rabbit wasn't sure of what, but they all shared a similar journey. If he was this weak, perhaps this was the reason the intelligence of these salmon and larger fishes were low.<br><br><strong>Why can't she fish?</strong><br><br>The rabbit bowed, thanking her for showing some mercy. He hurried over to the fishing pole.<br><br>After many successful catches, more than asked for even, a pile of fish flopped helplessly next to the campfire. <br><br>The fox sat next to the rabbit on the log, eating very large bites and warming the fish with their paws<br><br>Meanwhile the rabbit prepared quickly newer bowls for the fox with what herbs he had left and the salt he had from the mineral rocks. <br><br>He was able to grab some from a lotus, out of view, but next to him.<br><br>He ate smaller portions as the fox permitted, nervously glancing up with each bite. Gradually his health recovered.<br><br><strong>"I don't know if I'll be able to take all this fish home."</strong><br><br>The fox whined with disappointment.<br><br><strong>"It's a pity."</strong><br><br>She cried emotionally at the loss of such good food while she ate.<br><br>The rabbit hesitantly offered help<br><br><strong>"My lotus could hold onto them."</strong><br><br><strong>"Oh? Those strange petals can do that?"</strong><br><br>Curious, she looked at the white petals emerging from the rip on the rabbits ear. <br><br>They had also emerged from his back, but now that he had recovered they had left him less frequently. <br><br>The white lotus petals surrounded the lake, some in full- others in smaller fragments and tears.<br><br>He nodded.<br><br><strong>"It's a shame nature gave them to such a weak rabbit."</strong><br><br><strong>"I don't think you'd be able to make the journey."</strong><br><br>The fox took another harsh bite of her fish.<br><br>Why did she not change in size despite eating the same fish as the rabbit in weight? <br><br>He looked at his fur. The dull tone it took when he was injured was gone, although he still felt quite messy. <br><br><strong>"Maybe I could if you protected me?"</strong><br><br><strong>"HAH!"</strong> <br><br>She smiled, and laughed obnoxiously.<br><br><strong>"You think I would shield you, rabbit? I'll consider it. Show me this lotus of yours."</strong><br><br><strong>"Do you have a name?"</strong> The rabbit asked, retrieving the white lotus. <br><br>As he put his paw over it, petals from the air were vacuumed into it as it fluxuated between different hues and brightnesses. Some of the petals bright and beautiful, some wilted and dead.<br><br><strong>"You will call me Naori. I don't know what I will call you."</strong><br><br><strong>"I'm still not certain what to call myself. I can't remember what my name was in a past life."</strong><br><br>Naori laughed.<br><br><strong>"That shouldn't matter! That life has passed. You need a name if your going to live a little longer."</strong><br><br><strong>"I'll call you Fuwa. Your a soft white rabbit. And your tasty."</strong></div>
