    <div class="author_note"><strong>## Author's Note</strong><br><br>Hi guys! I'm really sorry about rewriting this so many times. 1st manuscript was a bust, writers block is a hell of pain, and the webcomic was difficult for me (my drawing skills suck).<br><br><strong>HOPEFULLY</strong> I can write Chapter 1 and not go back and decide to do a total rewrite for the 100th time. (Future me, if your rereading this, <strong>DONT DO IT!!! PLEASE. THINK OF YOUR SANITY.</strong>)<br><br>I will keep working on improving my art so that it's appealing. If you're reading this during the early stages, your going to see my messy code. And my messy art. Trust me. A new shiny coat of paint will come. I'll try to commission better artists than me if enough of you complain lol.<br><br>Alright, I've ranted enough. I hope you enjoy the story! ^-^</div>
