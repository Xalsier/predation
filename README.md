#### Documentation for Community Review for Localization:

- 'false' can be added to the second element of an array in ../JSON/user_interface, as a flag to let others know this item may potentially be poorly translated, or may not have the intending meaning. For example:

```
"es": ["¡Capítulo 3 ya está disponible! (¡Y es casi el doble del tamaño del Capítulo 1!)", false],
```

Some may be missing an object array, these can be added to suit this purpose. The code (Should) be able to handle the differences.

## New features currently on the English Repository
